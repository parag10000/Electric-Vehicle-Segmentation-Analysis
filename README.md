# Electric-Vehicle-Segmentation-Analysis


 **Background**
      
      The electric vehicle industry in India is a growing industry. 
      Electric Vehicles include a large range of vehicles from electric two - wheelers, three - wheelers (rickshaws), cars and electric buses. 
      An electric vehicle can be classified on the basis of their attributes such as charging time, driving range, and the maximum load it can carry. 
      Of these attributes, 
              The two most important characteristics of an electric vehicle of concern to the consumer are:
                         1. Driving range(i.e. Maximum distance an EV can run when fully charged) 
                         2. Charging time of batteries(i.e. the time required to fully charge the battery) 
               And Charging time depends on the input power characteristics (i.e. input voltage and current), battery type and battery capacity. 
               Therefore, such a vehicle is seen as a possible replacement for : 
                          Current-generation automobiles,in order to address the issue of rising pollution, global warming, depleting natural resources, etc.


**Problem Statement**

       We are a team working under an Electric Vehicle Startup. The Startup is still deciding in which vehicle/customer space it will be develop its EVs. 
       We have to analyse the Electric Vehicle market in India using Segmentation analysis.
       We have to then come up with a feasible strategy to enter the market, targeting the segments most likely to use Electric vehicles. 

**Fermi Estimation** 
      
      The main task is to find out the vehicle space in which the EV startup will develop its products.For this, we use a dataset which has the preferred car characteristics of the customers in the market. As we are using the preferences and interests of the customers and also considering the frequency of purchase (as it is selling well in the market) and amount spent on purchasing, we can say that the segmentation criterion is psychographic and behavioural segmentation. And we use machine learning algorithms for segmentation of the dataset, after we have done with profiling it, we can then find the most optimal market segments to open in the markets.
